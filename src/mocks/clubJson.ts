Everyone tends to have a wide array of tastes, yet we all come together to enjoy the same shows. Aside from shows, our other activities include Kahoot trivia nights, Iron Cosplay, local events, anime merch swap/trade meets, potlucks, etc. We’re always open to new ideas for meetings as well so feel free to participate in the discussion. Now you may be wondering, why A3? The 3 stands for our three tenets: culture, social, and education. We seek to do what other anime clubs don't. We explore the culture in anime and integrate it into meetings and host grounds for making friends and establishing bonds. Not only can we take the time to appreciate anime and manga for what it is, but we can also take the time to dissect them and see how to better the lives of others as well.”",
